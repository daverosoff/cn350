                    Let <m>A</m> be a nonempty subset of the natural numbers <m>\N</m> satisfying
                    <ol>

        </theorem>
        <p>
            We usually apply the induction theorem in a highly implicit way. It is only
            invoked by name in introductory texts like this one. We have a sequence of
            theorems we
            wish to prove by induction. Usually we are too lazy to speak this way
            and we say we are proving one theorem, but about every natural number
            instead of a specific one (or about trees of arbitrary height instead of
            trees of height <m>n</m>).
            Each theorem in our sequence has a hypothesis <m>P_n</m> and a conclusion
            <m>Q_n</m>. Often all of the <m>P_n</m> are the same, but it doesn't hurt
            anything to let them be different. It happens even more often that
            all of the <m>Q_n</m> are specializations
            of a statement about integers to a specific integer. What
            we do when we write a proof
            by induction is to apply the induction theorem to the set <m>S</m> defined by
            <me>
                S = \{ n \in \N : P_n \implies Q_n \}
            </me>,
            that is, the set of natural numbers (or e.g. tree heights) for which our
            theorem holds. If we can show the hypotheses of the induction theorem
            apply to the set <m>S</m>, our proof is complete, because the conclusion
            of the induction theorem then entails that <m>S = \N</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is what I meant in class when I spoke of an <q>argument machine</q>.
            As stated above, none of this framework is ever explicitly mentioned
            in practice. In undergraduate books, it is considered enough to mention
            induction, prove a <q>base case</q> and an <q>induction step</q> or
            <q>inductive case</q> (two phrases for the same thing), and voil√†! The proof is
            complete.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus, the <q>induction framework</q> consists of arranging your argument
            so that the sequences <m>P_n</m> and <m>Q_n</m> are clear. We call the
            theorem <q><m>P_0 \implies Q_0</m></q> the <q>base case</q>. This theorem
            could also be stated as <q><m>0 \in S</m></q>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The inductive case is always phrased as a conditional. <q><em>If</em>
            <m>n</m> is a natural number that is in <m>S</m>, <em>then</em>
            <m>n+1</m> is also in <m>S</m>.</q> If you recall the definition of
            <m>S</m>, you will see that this conditional is equivalent to
            <me>
                \left( P_n \implies Q_n \right) \implies \left( P_{n+1} \implies Q_{n+1} \right)
            </me>.
            So, we usually formulate our induction step in the latter way. My
            <em>induction hypothesis</em> would be <q><m>P_n</m> implies <m>Q_n</m></q>.
            From this hypothesis I would attempt to deduce the conclusion,
            <q><m>P_{n+1}</m> implies <m>Q_{n+1}</m></q>.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a final thought, I should tell you that in our real writing,
            we <em>don't</em> usually assign values like <m>P_n</m> to
            specific predicates like <q><m>6</m> divides <m>n^3 - n</m></q>. I have
            done so here to aid in my clear expression, but you should try to craft
            your argument without using phrases like:
            <ol>
                <li><q>now let <m>k = n</m></q></li>
                <li><q>assume <m>P_n</m></q></li>
                <li><q>the theorem is true for <m>n</m></q></li>
            </ol>

                      Show, using induction, that if <m>n</m> is a natural number, then

                          Here <m>P_n</m> is the empty statement and <m>Q_n</m> is
                          the statement <q><m>3</m> divides <m>4^n - 1</m></q>. The empty
                          statement is indistinguishable from the logical constant

                      The base case is to show that <m>0</m> satisfies the conclusion of
                      the statement. But <m>3 \cdot 0 = 0 = 4^0 - 1</m>, so the base case
                      is done.

                  <p>
                      The inductive case is always phrased as a conditional. <q><em>If</em>
                      <m>n</m> is a natural number that is in <m>A</m>, <em>then</em>
                      <m>n+1</m> is also in <m>A</m>.</q> Let us prove this statement. We will
                      use a direct proof, assuming the hypothesis (<m>3</m> divides <m>4^n - 1</m>) and
                      deducing the conclusion (<m>3</m> divides <m>4^{n+1} - 1</m>).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      Since <m>3</m> divides <m>4^n - 1</m>, the definition of divisibility
                      tells us
                      there is <m>k</m> such that
                      <me>
                          3k = 4^n - 1.
                      </me>
                      Multiplying this equation by 4 and adding 3, we obtain
                      <me>
                          12k + 3 = 4(4^n - 1) + 3 = 4^{n+1} - 4 + 3 = 4^{n+1} - 1.
                      </me>
                      Since <m>12k + 3 = 3(4k + 1)</m>, we have shown that <m>3 \cdot (4k + 1) = 4^{n+1} - 1</m>
                      and the induction step is complete, as is the proof.

                  The base case is <m>n = 0</m> just like before. The inductive step is to prove: if <m>6</m>
                  divides <m>n^3 - n</m>, it also divides <m>(n+1)^3 - (n+1)</m>.

                  Here are some helpful facts that you can use without proof. In a math class, we'd prove these
                  as exercises as well, but here I'm hoping to provide enough math hints that you can focus more
                  on the logical structure of the argument and less on the arithmetic.

                  In this activity we deal with points in the <m>n</m>-dimensional Euclidean space <m>\R^n</m>.
                  Such a point is specified by an <m>n</m>-tuple of coordinates <m>(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)</m>,

                      You can probably draw all 13
                      tilings of the <m>2 \times 6</m> grid quite easily.
                      It turns out that 13 is also the value
                      of <m>F_7</m>, the 7th Fibonacci number.
                      This isn't a coincidence, as you're asked to show below.

                      Using the recurrence relation above and the induction framework, show that there are <m>F_{n+1}</m>
                      such tilings of the <m>2 \times n</m> array by dominoes, for all <m>n \geq 0</m>.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <em>Note.</em> For <m>n = 0</m>, we say that there is one way to tile an empty array with no dominoes. There would be
                      zero ways to do it with more dominoes, and zero ways to tile a nonempty array with no dominoes.

                      Consider the ways in which a tiling of a <m>2 \times (n + 2)</m> array can arise from a smaller tiling.
                      Remember, you need to show that the number of <m>(n+2)</m>-tilings is the sum of the number of
                      <m>n</m>-tilings and the number of <m>(n+1)</m>-tilings.

                  <p>
                      If we look at the last two columns of an <m>(n+2)</m>-tiling, they have to either be both horizontal
                      dominoes or both vertical. If they are both horizontal, removing both dominoes yields an <m>n</m>-tiling.
                      If they are both vertical, removing the last one only yields an <m>(n+1)</m>-tiling.

                          It is enough to show that given a nonempty finite set of
                          cars, all of them are the same color. Since mine is blue,
                          the result will follow at once. Let us prove by induction
                          that every nonempty finite set of cars is monochromatic.
                          If the set has just one car, it is surely monochromatic.
                          Now let us suppose, by way of induction, that for some
                          positive integer <m>n</m> it has already been shown that every
                          set of <m>n</m> cars is monochromatic.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          Consider a set <m>X</m> of <m>n + 1</m> cars. We may form sets
                          <m>Y_1</m>, <m>Y_2, \ldots, Y_{n+1}</m> by deleting the <m>i</m>th car from <m>X</m> to form <m>Y_i</m>.
                          Applying the induction hypothesis to each of the sets <m>Y_i</m>
                          we see that each of these sets is monochromatic.
                          But then <m>X</m> is monochromatic as well, and the proof is complete.
