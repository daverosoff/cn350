                    We say a set <m>A</m> is <term>finite</term> if there is a nonnegative integer 
                    <m>n</m>
                    such that the proposition
                    <men>A \text{ has $n$ elements}</men>
                    is true. If <m>A</m> is a finite set, then <m>\abs{A}</m> denotes the size of 
                    <m>A</m>, the number of its elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A one-to-one correspondence or bijection is a function that can be reversed.
                    Given a function <m>f \colon A \to B</m>, you can tell that <m>f</m> is a 
                    bijection if it pairs each <q>input</q> (argument) to a <em>unique</em> output
                    (value).

                    Let <m>A</m> be a finite set. How many functions are there with
                    domain <m>A</m> and codomain <m>\mathbf{\overline{2}} = \{0,1\}</m>?

                    <p>
                        Try listing all possibilities for <m>\abs{A} = 1, 2, 3</m>. A pattern should emerge.
                        Once you think you see it, try to explain why that is the answer. The lists you
                        made for the small examples should help you see the <q>general</q> case.

                    Establish a one-to-one correspondence (i.e., a bijection)
                    between the set of functions <m>A \to \mathbf{\overline{2}}</m> and the power
                    set <m>2^A = \{ B : B \subseteq A \}</m>.

                    <p>
                        The <q>inputs</q> of your bijection could be the functions <m>A \to \mathbf{\overline{2}}</m>
                        and the <q>outputs</q> the elements of the set <m>2^A</m>.

                        Define a function <me>
                            \mathrm{ev}_1 \colon 
                            \{ f : f \text{ is a function $A \to \mathbf{\overline{2}}$} \} \to 2^A
                        </me>
                        by the equation <m>\mathrm{ev}_1(f) = \{ x \in A : f(x) = 1 \}</m>. We will show that
                        <m>\mathrm{ev}_1</m> is a bijection. Bijections are functions with two properties:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If <m>s \ne t</m> then <m>G(s) \ne G(t)</m> (no overlap/collision; at most one inbound arrow
                        for each codomain element)</li>
                        <li>For each <m>y</m> in the codomain, there is <m>x</m> in the domain such that
                        <m>G(x) = y</m> (every codomain element <q>covered</q>; at least one inbound arrow for 
                        each codomain element)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Suppose that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are distinct functions <m>A \to \mathbf{\overline{2}}</m>.
                        We need to show that <m>\mathrm{ev}_1(f) \ne \mathrm{ev}_1(g)</m>. The first is the subset of
                        <m>A</m> on which <m>f</m> takes the value <m>1</m>. The second is the same set, but for
                        <m>g</m>. Since <m>f \ne g</m>, there is some <m>x \in A</m> where <m>f(x) \ne g(x)</m>. Since
                        the only possible values of these functions are <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>, it follows that
                        exactly one of <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> is equal to <m>1</m>. Hence <m>x</m> is a member of
                        <m>\mathrm{ev}_1(f)</m> or <m>\mathrm{ev}_1(g)</m>, but not both. This shows that <m>\mathrm{ev}_1</m>
                        has the first property of a bijection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To obtain the second, let us choose an arbitrary element <m>S \in 2^A</m>. This <m>S</m> is just
                        a subset of <m>A</m>. We must show that there exists a function <m>h</m> such that 
                        <m>\mathrm{ev}_1(h) = S</m>. We may of course define <me>
                            h(x) = \begin{cases}
                                0 \amp \text{if $x \notin S$} \\
                                1 \amp \text{if $x \in S$} \\
                            \end{cases}
                        </me>
                        and then we see at once that <m>h</m> has the desired property. We have now shown that <m>\mathrm{ev}_1</m>
                        has both properties of a bijection.

                    Conclude that <m>\abs{\{f \colon A \to \mathbf{\overline{2}}\}} = \abs{2^A}</m>,
                    and identify the common value of these expressions. (Your answer will
                    depend on <m>A</m>.)

                        Since we have seen a bijection between these sets, they have the same
                        size. We listed all the binary functions on <m>n</m> variables; there
                        are <m>2^n</m> of them, so there must be <m>2^n</m> subsets of <m>A</m>
                        as well. Observe these combine to say <me>
                            \abs{2^A} = 2^{\abs{A}}

                        Show, using induction, that if <m>n</m> is a natural number, then
                        <m>3</m> divides <m>4^n - 1</m>.

                    <p>
                        The base case is to show that <m>0</m> satisfies the conclusion of
                        the statement. But <m>3 \cdot 0 = 0 = 4^0 - 1</m>, so the base case
                        is done.

                    <p>
                        The inductive case is always phrased as a conditional. <q><em>If</em>
                        <m>n</m> is a natural number that is in <m>A</m>, <em>then</em>
                        <m>n+1</m> is also in <m>A</m>.</q> Let us prove this statement. We will
                        use a direct proof, assuming the hypothesis (<m>3</m> divides <m>4^n - 1</m>) and
                        deducing the conclusion (<m>3</m> divides <m>4^{n+1} - 1</m>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since <m>3</m> divides <m>4^n - 1</m>, the definition of divisibility
                        tells us 
                        there is <m>k</m> such that
                        <me>
                            3k = 4^n - 1.
                        </me>
                        Multiplying this equation by 4 and adding 3, we obtain
                        <me>
                            12k + 3 = 4(4^n - 1) + 3 = 4^{n+1} - 4 + 3 = 4^{n+1} - 1.
                        </me>
                        Since <m>12k + 3 = 3(4k + 1)</m>, we have shown that <m>3 \cdot (4k + 1) = 4^{n+1} - 1</m>
                        and the induction step is complete, as is the proof.

                    Here are some helpful facts that you can use without proof. In a math class, we'd prove these
                    as exercises as well, but here I'm hoping to provide enough math hints that you can focus more
                    on the logical structure of the argument and less on the arithmetic.

                    In this activity we deal with points in the <m>n</m>-dimensional Euclidean space <m>\R^n</m>.
                    Such a point is specified by an <m>n</m>-tuple of coordinates <m>(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)</m>,
                    where each <m>x_i \in \R</m>.

                    The <em>unit cube</em> in <m>\R^n</m>, or <em>unit <m>n</m>-cube</em>, is the subset <m>I^n</m>
                    of <m>\R^n</m> defined by

                    Just as a 3-dimensional cube has 2-, 1-, and 0-dimensional faces (usually called faces, edges, and corners,
                    respectively), the <m>n</m>-cube has faces of all lower dimensions. We are interested in the corners.

                        Consider a rectangular <m>2 \times n</m> array of squares, and the problem of determining
                        the number of ways it may be tiled by <m>n</m> dominoes. Each domino must cover exactly 2 adjacent
                        squares, without overlaps. So, one way is to use all parallel dominoes. If <m>n</m> happens to
                        be even, all horizontal dominoes will work as well.

                        You can probably draw all 8 tilings of the <m>2 \times 6</m> grid quite easily. It turns out that 8 is also the value
                        of <m>F_7</m>, the 7th Fibonacci number. This isn't a coincidence, as you're asked to show below.

                    <p>
                        Using the recurrence relation above and the induction framework, show that there are <m>F_{n+1}</m>
                        such tilings of the <m>2 \times n</m> array by dominoes, for all <m>n \geq 0</m>.

                    <p>
                        <em>Note.</em> For <m>n = 0</m>, we say that there is one way to tile an empty array with no dominoes. There would be
                        zero ways to do it with more dominoes, and zero ways to tile a nonempty array with no dominoes.

                        Consider the ways in which a tiling of a <m>2 \times (n + 2)</m> array can arise from a smaller tiling.
                        Remember, you need to show that the number of <m>(n+2)</m>-tilings is the sum of the number of
                        <m>n</m>-tilings and the number of <m>(n+1)</m>-tilings.

                        If we look at the last two columns of an <m>(n+2)</m>-tiling, they have to either be both horizontal
                        dominoes or both vertical. If they are both horizontal, removing both dominoes yields an <m>n</m>-tiling.
                        If they are both vertical, removing the last one only yields an <m>(n+1)</m>-tiling.

                        <p>
                            It is enough to show that given a nonempty finite set of 
                            cars, all of them are the same color. Since mine is blue, 
                            the result will follow at once. Let us prove by induction 
                            that every nonempty finite set of cars is monochromatic. 
                            If the set has just one car, it is surely monochromatic. 
                            Now let us suppose, by way of induction, that for some 
                            positive integer <m>n</m> it has already been shown that every 
                            set of <m>n</m> cars is monochromatic. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Consider a set <m>X</m> of <m>n + 1</m> cars. We may form sets 
                            <m>Y_1</m>, <m>Y_2, \ldots, Y_{n+1}</m> by deleting the <m>i</m>th car from <m>X</m> to form <m>Y_i</m>.
                            Applying the induction hypothesis to each of the sets <m>Y_i</m>
                            we see that each of these sets is monochromatic. 
                            But then <m>X</m> is monochromatic as well, and the proof is complete.
