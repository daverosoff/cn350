            <introduction>
                <p>
                    We say a set <m>A</m> is <term>finite</term> if there is a nonnegative integer
                    <m>n</m>
                    such that the proposition
                    <men>A \text{ has $n$ elements}</men>
                    is true. If <m>A</m> is a finite set, then <m>\abs{A}</m> denotes the size of
                    <m>A</m>, the number of its elements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A one-to-one correspondence or bijection is a function that can be reversed.
                    Given a function <m>f \colon A \to B</m>, you can tell that <m>f</m> is a
                    bijection if it pairs each <q>input</q> (argument) to a <em>unique</em> output
                    (value).
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let <m>A</m> be a finite set. How many functions are there with
                    domain <m>A</m> and codomain <m>\mathbf{\overline{2}} = \{0,1\}</m>?
                </p>
                <hint>
                    <p>
                        Try listing all possibilities for <m>\abs{A} = 1, 2, 3</m>. A pattern should emerge.
                        Once you think you see it, try to explain why that is the answer. The lists you
                        made for the small examples should help you see the <q>general</q> case.
                    </p>

            <task>
                <p>
                    Establish a one-to-one correspondence (i.e., a bijection)
                    between the set of functions <m>A \to \mathbf{\overline{2}}</m> and the power
                    set <m>2^A = \{ B : B \subseteq A \}</m>.
                </p>
                <hint>
                    <p>
                        The <q>inputs</q> of your bijection could be the functions <m>A \to \mathbf{\overline{2}}</m>
                        and the <q>outputs</q> the elements of the set <m>2^A</m>.
                    </p>
                </hint>
                <solution>
                    <p>
                        Define a function <me>
                            \mathrm{ev}_1 \colon
                            \{ f : f \text{ is a function $A \to \mathbf{\overline{2}}$} \} \to 2^A
                        </me>
                        by the equation <m>\mathrm{ev}_1(f) = \{ x \in A : f(x) = 1 \}</m>. We will show that
                        <m>\mathrm{ev}_1</m> is a bijection. Bijections are functions with two properties:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If <m>s \ne t</m> then <m>G(s) \ne G(t)</m> (no overlap/collision; at most one inbound arrow
                        for each codomain element)</li>
                        <li>For each <m>y</m> in the codomain, there is <m>x</m> in the domain such that
                        <m>G(x) = y</m> (every codomain element <q>covered</q>; at least one inbound arrow for
                        each codomain element)</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Suppose that <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are distinct functions <m>A \to \mathbf{\overline{2}}</m>.
                        We need to show that <m>\mathrm{ev}_1(f) \ne \mathrm{ev}_1(g)</m>. The first is the subset of
                        <m>A</m> on which <m>f</m> takes the value <m>1</m>. The second is the same set, but for
                        <m>g</m>. Since <m>f \ne g</m>, there is some <m>x \in A</m> where <m>f(x) \ne g(x)</m>. Since
                        the only possible values of these functions are <m>0</m> and <m>1</m>, it follows that
                        exactly one of <m>f(x)</m> and <m>g(x)</m> is equal to <m>1</m>. Hence <m>x</m> is a member of
                        <m>\mathrm{ev}_1(f)</m> or <m>\mathrm{ev}_1(g)</m>, but not both. This shows that <m>\mathrm{ev}_1</m>
                        has the first property of a bijection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To obtain the second, let us choose an arbitrary element <m>S \in 2^A</m>. This <m>S</m> is just
                        a subset of <m>A</m>. We must show that there exists a function <m>h</m> such that
                        <m>\mathrm{ev}_1(h) = S</m>. We may of course define <me>
                            h(x) = \begin{cases}
                                0 \amp \text{if $x \notin S$} \\
                                1 \amp \text{if $x \in S$} \\
                            \end{cases}
                        </me>
                        and then we see at once that <m>h</m> has the desired property. We have now shown that <m>\mathrm{ev}_1</m>
                        has both properties of a bijection.
                    </p>
                </solution>
            </task>
            <task>
                <p>
                    Conclude that <m>\abs{\{f \colon A \to \mathbf{\overline{2}}\}} = \abs{2^A}</m>,
                    and identify the common value of these expressions. (Your answer will
                    depend on <m>A</m>.)
                </p>
                <solution>
                    <p>
                        Since we have seen a bijection between these sets, they have the same
                        size. We listed all the binary functions on <m>n</m> variables; there
                        are <m>2^n</m> of them, so there must be <m>2^n</m> subsets of <m>A</m>
                        as well. Observe these combine to say <me>
                            \abs{2^A} = 2^{\abs{A}}
                        </me>
                        for every finite set <m>A</m>.
