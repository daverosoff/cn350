  <p>

    This assignment covers sections 2.3 through 2.5 in HMU. Each problem will
    be worth 3 checks. Your answers should be like little essays, made only of
    complete sentences. Formulas should never stand on their own, but should be
    parts of otherwise complete sentences. You should be able to read your
    answer aloud from beginning to end and have it sound sensible. If your
    solution is more like a pile of equations, with little or no connecting
    narration, you'll max out at 2 checks.

          Each of the following languages is the complement of a simpler language. In each
          part, construct a DFA for the simpler language, then use it to give the state diagram
          of a DFA for the language given. In all parts, <m>\Sigma = \{a,b\}</m>.

          Each of the languages below is the <term>concatenation</term> of two
          simpler languages. The concatenation of languages <m>B</m> and <m>C</m>
          is the language <m>BC = \{xy : x \in B \text{ and } y \in C\}</m>.
          For each language, give a single <m>\varepsilon</m>-NFA that accepts it.
          The language is always <m>\Sigma = \{a, b\}</m>.

          to connect them.
