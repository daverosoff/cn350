  <title>Homework 01</title>
  <p>This assignment covers 2.1 and 2.2 in HMU. Each problem will be worth 3 checks. Your answers
    should be like little essays, made only of complete sentences. Formulas should never stand
    on their own, but should be parts of otherwise complete sentences. You should be able to read
    your answer aloud from beginning to end and have it sound sensible. If your solution is
    more like a pile of equations, with little or no connecting narration, you'll max out at 2 checks.

          If <m>L</m> is a language (a subset of <m>\aster{\Sigma}</m>) then
          its <term>complement</term> is the language <me>
            \aster{\Sigma} - L = \{ x \in \aster{\Sigma} : x \notin L \}
          </me>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Show that if <m>M</m> is a DFA that accepts language <m>B</m>,
          then swapping the accept and nonaccept states in <m>M</m>
          yields a DFA that accepts <m>\aster{\Sigma} - B</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          Start by supposing
          (your hypothesis) that a DFA <m>M</m> has been given, and it accepts <m>B</m>.
          That is to say, suppose <m>M</m> is a DFA such that <m>L(M) = B</m>.
          Use this assumption and what you have learned about DFA to argue
          persuasively and in detail that
          when the states are swapped, the resulting machine accepts all words
          not in <m>B</m> and rejects all words in <m>B</m>. Since you don't
          have a transition diagram to fall back on, you'll need to use the
          formal description of the DFA in terms of sets and functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          An earlier version of this Hint said that this isn't an induction proof.
          That was a little overeager. It is very possible to give a persuasive proof
          that doesn't use it, but I shouldn't have said you <em>can't</em>. In this
          particular case, though, I don't think the inductive argument is simpler or
          more convenient.
        </p>
      </hint>

    <exercise>
      <statement>
        <p>
          For any word <m>w = a_1 a_2 \ldots a_n</m>, its <term>reverse</term> <m>w^R</m>
          is defined to be <me>w^R = a_n \ldots a_2 a_1</me>, so the symbols appear in the
          reverse order. Recall that a language is <term>regular</term> if it is accepted by some DFA.
          Show that if <m>B</m> is a regular language, so is the language <m>B^R</m>, where
          <me>
            B^R = \{ w^R : w \in B \}
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
      <hint>
        <p>
          In the previous problem, a modification to the DFA was suggested:
          swap the accepting and non-accepting states. In this one, you will need
          to concoct the modification yourself, and give some of the details of why
          the resulting thing is a DFA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since you don't have a transition diagram to fall back on, you'll need to use the
          formal description of the DFA in terms of sets and functions. There are two things to
          prove: first, that <m>B^R</m> contains all words <m>w^R</m> where <m>w \in B</m>,
          and second, that <m>B^R</m> does not contain any word that isn't the reverse of a word in
          <m>B</m>.
