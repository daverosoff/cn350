            Suppose that <m>L</m> is a language we wish to prove
            is not regular, using the Pumping Lemma. The proof begins
            like this: <q>If <m>L</m> is regular, then the Pumping
            Lemma says it must have a pumping constant <m>p</m></q>.
            The Pumping Lemma says that every word of length at least
            <m>p</m> can be split into three parts, <m>xyz</m>, where
            <m>|xy| \leq p</m> and <m>|y| \geq 1</m>, such that
            <m>xy^kz \in L</m> for all <m>k \geq 0</m>. We sometimes
            call <m>y</m> a <term>pumpable substring</term> or even
            just a <term>pump</term>. The proof generally proceeds by
            finding a word <m>w</m> that is in <m>L</m> and that has
            no pumpable substring. This is a contradiction of the
            Pumping Lemma, and shows our assumption (that <m>L</m> was
            regular) must be false.

            <solution>
                <p>
                    The pumping lemma does not relate the value of <m>p</m> to
                    the language <m>L</m>. It only states that <m>p</m> exists
                    and has the specified properties. Given the length <m>p</m>,
                    we can choose any convenient word
                    <m>w</m> as long as <m>\abs{w} \geq p</m>. However, we have
                    to examine all the decompositions, so we don't get to choose
                    <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, or <m>z</m>. We only have to show that
                    (for every choice of <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m>)
                    there is <em>some</em> value of <m>k</m> such that
                    <m>xy^kz \notin L</m>, so we get to choose <m>k</m>.

                    A string of left brackets <c>(</c> and right brackets

                    What is a good choice of <m>w</m> for proving that

            The balanced bracket languages play an important role in the structure
            theory of the Chomsky hierarchy, as we'll see later on. They are also
            connected to an interesting numerical sequence, the <em>Catalan numbers</em>.
            You can learn more about the Catalan numbers at <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number" visual="Wikipedia"/>. There are many diagrams there
            which I expect you will find entertaining.

                    Watch the video segment for the language of your choice.
                    Then try to reproduce the proof without looking back.
                    It's annoying to write proofs during class, but try.
                    Work in groups of 4 or more (so I can be sure to see
                    everyone's proof).
