            <statement>
                <p>
                    Suppose that <m>L</m> is a language we wish to prove
                    is not regular, using the Pumping Lemma. The proof begins
                    like this: <q>If <m>L</m> is regular, then the Pumping
                    Lemma says it must have a pumping constant <m>p</m></q>.
                    The Pumping Lemma says that every word of length at least
                    <m>p</m> can be split into three parts, <m>xyz</m>, where
                    <m>|xy| \leq p</m> and <m>|y| \geq 1</m>, such that
                    <m>xy^kz \in L</m> for all <m>k \geq 0</m>. We sometimes
                    call <m>y</m> a <term>pumpable substring</term> or even
                    just a <term>pump</term>. The proof generally proceeds by
                    finding a word <m>w</m> that is in <m>L</m> and that has
                    no pumpable substring. This is a contradiction of the
                    Pumping Lemma, and shows our assumption (that <m>L</m> was
                    regular) must be false.

                    Only <xref ref="uufaf-true"/> and <xref ref="uasdf-true"/> are
                    true.

            <solution>
                <p>
                    The pumping lemma does not relate the value of <m>p</m> to
                    the language <m>L</m>. It only states that <m>p</m> exists
                    and has the specified properties. Given the length <m>p</m>,
                    we can choose any convenient word
                    <m>w</m> as long as <m>\abs{w} \geq p</m>. However, we have
                    to examine all the decompositions, so we don't get to choose
                    <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, or <m>z</m>. We only have to show that
                    (for every choice of <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, <m>z</m>)
                    there is <em>some</em> value of <m>k</m> such that
                    <m>xy^kz \notin L</m>, so we get to choose <m>k</m>.

                    What is a good choice of <m>w</m> for proving that each of
