<div class="para">by the equation <span class="process-math">\(\mathrm{ev}_1(f) = \{ x \in A : f(x) = 1 \}\text{.}\)</span> We will show that <span class="process-math">\(\mathrm{ev}_1\)</span> is a bijection. Bijections are functions with two properties:</div>
</div> <ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(s \ne t\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(G(s) \ne G(t)\)</span> (no overlap/collision; at most one inbound arrow for each codomain element)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">For each <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in the codomain, there is <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in the domain such that <span class="process-math">\(G(x) = y\)</span> (every codomain element “covered”; at least one inbound arrow for each codomain element)</div></li>
</ol> <div class="para">Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> are distinct functions <span class="process-math">\(A \to \mathbf{\overline{2}}\text{.}\)</span> We need to show that <span class="process-math">\(\mathrm{ev}_1(f) \ne \mathrm{ev}_1(g)\text{.}\)</span> The first is the subset of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> on which <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> takes the value <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> The second is the same set, but for <span class="process-math">\(g\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(f \ne g\text{,}\)</span> there is some <span class="process-math">\(x \in A\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(f(x) \ne g(x)\text{.}\)</span> Since the only possible values of these functions are <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> it follows that exactly one of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> is equal to <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a member of <span class="process-math">\(\mathrm{ev}_1(f)\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\mathrm{ev}_1(g)\text{,}\)</span> but not both. This shows that <span class="process-math">\(\mathrm{ev}_1\)</span> has the first property of a bijection.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">To obtain the second, let us choose an arbitrary element <span class="process-math">\(S \in 2^A\text{.}\)</span> This <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is just a subset of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> We must show that there exists a function <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(\mathrm{ev}_1(h) = S\text{.}\)</span> We may of course define</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
h(x) = \begin{cases}
0 \amp \text{if $x \notin S$} \\
1 \amp \text{if $x \in S$} \\
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">and then we see at once that <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> has the desired property. We have now shown that <span class="process-math">\(\mathrm{ev}_1\)</span> has both properties of a bijection.</div>
