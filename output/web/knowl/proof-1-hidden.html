<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><div class="para">It is enough to show that given a nonempty finite set of cars, all of them are the same color. Since mine is blue, the result will follow at once. Let us prove by induction that every nonempty finite set of cars is monochromatic. If the set has just one car, it is surely monochromatic. Now let us suppose, by way of induction, that for some positive integer <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> it has already been shown that every set of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> cars is monochromatic.</div> <div class="para">Consider a set <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(n + 1\)</span> cars. We may form sets <span class="process-math">\(Y_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(Y_2, \ldots, Y_{n+1}\)</span> by deleting the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>th car from <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> to form <span class="process-math">\(Y_i\text{.}\)</span> Applying the induction hypothesis to each of the sets <span class="process-math">\(Y_i\)</span> we see that each of these sets is monochromatic. But then <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is monochromatic as well, and the proof is complete.</div></article></body>
