<div class="para">We will use induction, but of the “mutual” variety. Here are the three statements we will prove by induction:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">
<span class="process-math">\(\hat{\delta}(q_0, w)\)</span> contains <span class="process-math">\(q_0\)</span> for every word <span class="process-math">\(w\text{.}\)</span>

</div></li>
</ol>
<div class="para">Observe before continuing that only statement <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex-nfa-language-important.html" title="Item 3">3</a> is really required by the theorem, but to make the induction go, we need to assume something about the other states too. This is typical of inductive proofs for DFA and NFA.</div>
</div> <div class="para">The induction begins with a base case, <span class="process-math">\(\abs{w} = 0\text{.}\)</span> We verify the three statements. All are obvious, since <span class="process-math">\(\varepsilon\)</span> doesn’t end in anything and <span class="process-math">\(\hat{\delta}(q_0, \varepsilon) = \{q_0\}\)</span> by <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def-nfa-deltahat.html" title="Definition 2.3.3">Definition 2.3.3</a>.</div> <div class="para">Next let us proceed to the inductive step. Consider a word <span class="process-math">\(w = xa\)</span> (remember that <span class="process-math">\(x \in \aster{\Sigma}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a \in \Sigma\)</span>). Then the length of <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is one more than the length of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> In symbols, <span class="process-math">\(\abs{w} = \abs{x} + 1\text{.}\)</span> We will assume that all three statements are true of the shorter word <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> and deduce them for the longer word <span class="process-math">\(w\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">To see that statement 1 holds for <span class="process-math">\(w\text{,}\)</span> we observe that by the induction hypothesis, <span class="process-math">\(q_0 \in \hat{\delta}(q_0, x)\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(w = x0\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(w = x1\text{,}\)</span> and there are loop transitions from <span class="process-math">\(q_0\)</span> labeled with both <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\(q_0 \in \hat{\delta}(q_0, w)\text{,}\)</span> as required.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">For statement 2, we need to prove both “directions” of the “if and only if” statement. It is a bit confusing if you have not seen it before. We say “<span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span>” when we wish to assert simultaneously that <span class="process-math">\(P \implies Q\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q \implies P\text{.}\)</span> The “forward” implication is <span class="process-math">\(P \implies Q\text{,}\)</span> which confusingly is the “only if” part of the proof. The “reverse” implication is <span class="process-math">\(Q \implies P\text{,}\)</span> which is the “if” part. In this case, the forward implication is</div>

\begin{equation*}
q_1 \in \hat{\delta}(q_0, w) \implies w \text{ ends in } 0

<div class="para">To prove the forward implication, we observe that only <span class="process-math">\(q_0\)</span> has a transition to <span class="process-math">\(q_1\text{,}\)</span> and that transition is labeled <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> So the last letter of <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> must be <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> For the reverse implication, suppose that <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> ends in <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> Because we have assumed statement 1 for the prefix <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(\hat{\delta}(q_0, x) \ni q_1\text{.}\)</span> Because there is a transition from <span class="process-math">\(q_0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(q_1\)</span> labeled <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> it follows that</div>
