<div class="para">In the previous problem, a modification to the DFA was suggested: swap the accepting and non-accepting states. In this one, you will need to concoct the modification yourself, and give some of the details of why the resulting thing is a DFA.</div> <div class="para">Since you don’t have a transition diagram to fall back on, you’ll need to use the formal description of the DFA in terms of sets and functions. There are two things to prove: first, that <span class="process-math">\(B^R\)</span> contains all words <span class="process-math">\(w^R\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(w \in B\text{,}\)</span> and second, that <span class="process-math">\(B^R\)</span> does not contain any word that isn’t the reverse of a word in <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span>
