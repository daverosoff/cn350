<div class="para">Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is a language we wish to prove is not regular, using the Pumping Lemma. The proof begins like this: “If <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is regular, then the Pumping Lemma says it must have a pumping constant <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>”. The Pumping Lemma says that every word of length at least <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> can be split into three parts, <span class="process-math">\(xyz\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(|xy| \leq p\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(|y| \geq 1\text{,}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(xy^kz \in L\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(k \geq 0\text{.}\)</span> We sometimes call <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> a <dfn class="terminology">pumpable substring</dfn> or even just a <dfn class="terminology">pump</dfn>. The proof generally proceeds by finding a word <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> that is in <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> and that has no pumpable substring. This is a contradiction of the Pumping Lemma, and shows our assumption (that <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> was regular) must be false.</div>
