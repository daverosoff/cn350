<div class="para">Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> are distinct functions <span class="process-math">\(A \to \mathbf{\overline{2}}\text{.}\)</span> We need to show that <span class="process-math">\(\mathrm{ev}_1(f) \ne \mathrm{ev}_1(g)\text{.}\)</span> The first is the subset of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> on which <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> takes the value <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> The second is the same set, but for <span class="process-math">\(g\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(f \ne g\text{,}\)</span> there is some <span class="process-math">\(x \in A\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(f(x) \ne g(x)\text{.}\)</span> Since the only possible values of these functions are <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1\text{,}\)</span> it follows that exactly one of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> is equal to <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a member of <span class="process-math">\(\mathrm{ev}_1(f)\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(\mathrm{ev}_1(g)\text{,}\)</span> but not both. This shows that <span class="process-math">\(\mathrm{ev}_1\)</span> has the first property of a bijection.</div>
