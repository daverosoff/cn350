<div class="para">The regular expressions that IDEs or editors provide are typically extended in ways that make them strictly more powerful than NFAs. There are also usually quality-of-life extensions, like character classes, that make regular expressions easier to read and write without making them more expressive. Of course, these extended regular expressions cannot be implemented via conversion to DFA as is often suggested. They must be handled in other ways, which are inevitably slower (some of the extensions, while fast in typical use cases, have <span class="process-math">\(O(2^n)\)</span> running time in the worst case).</div>
