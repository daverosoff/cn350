<div class="para">Start by supposing (your hypothesis) that a DFA <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> has been given, and it accepts <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> That is to say, suppose <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> is a DFA such that <span class="process-math">\(L(M) = B\text{.}\)</span> Use this assumption and what you have learned about DFA to argue persuasively and in detail that when the states are swapped, the resulting machine accepts all words not in <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and rejects all words in <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> Since you don’t have a transition diagram to fall back on, you’ll need to use the formal description of the DFA in terms of sets and functions.</div> <div class="para">An earlier version of this Hint said that this isn’t an induction proof. That was a little overeager. It is very possible to give a persuasive proof that doesn’t use it, but I shouldn’t have said you <em class="emphasis">can’t</em>. In this particular case, though, I don’t think the inductive argument is simpler or more convenient.</div>
