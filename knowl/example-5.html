<div class="para">Use the pumping lemma to show that <span class="process-math">\(L = \setof{0^n}{\text{$n$ is prime}}\)</span> is not regular.</div> <div class="para">Here, we have to be quite sneaky. The first problem is that the pumping constant probably isnâ€™t prime, but even if it is we have no way of knowing that. So we have to rely on the fact that the set of primes is unbounded: there is a prime greater than any given number. So we can choose <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> to be the smallest prime greater than <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> and then choose <span class="process-math">\(w = 0^{q+2}\text{.}\)</span> The reason for the <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> will be clear soon.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Now <span class="process-math">\(xy\)</span> is all zeroes, since <span class="process-math">\(w\)</span> is all zeroes. So <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is all zeroes. We need a value of <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(\abs{xy^kz} = \abs{xz} + k \abs{y}\)</span> is not prime. We cleverly let <span class="process-math">\(k = \abs{xz}\text{.}\)</span> Then</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\abs{xy^kz} \amp = \abs{xz} + k \abs{y}\\
\amp = \abs{xz} + \abs{xz} \abs{y}\\
\amp = \abs{xz} (1 + \abs{y})\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>
<div class="para">Now, because <span class="process-math">\(\abs{y} \geq 1\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(1 + \abs{y} \geq 2\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(\abs{xz} \geq 2\)</span> , the proof is complete, because we have a factorization of <span class="process-math">\(\abs{xy^kz}\)</span> into two numbers greater than 1. So we just have to show that <span class="process-math">\(\abs{xz} \geq 2\text{.}\)</span> This is where the <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(w = 0^{q+2}\)</span> comes in. We have <span class="process-math">\(\abs{xyz} \geq p + 2\text{,}\)</span> which is to say</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\abs{xy} + \abs{z} \geq p + 2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">We have to be careful with inequalities. But if we subtract <span class="process-math">\(\abs{xy}\)</span> from the left, we know we have reduced the left by at most <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> (possibly less), so we may subtract <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> from the right and the inequality will still hold. So we have</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\abs{z} \geq 2\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">as required.</div>
